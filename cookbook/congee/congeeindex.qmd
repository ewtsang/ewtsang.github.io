This comforting Chicken Congee recipe is inspired by my dad’s Cantonese cooking style — a dish he perfected with a deep sense of patience and love. It's warming, easy to digest, and the ultimate cozy meal.

## Ingredients

-   [ ] 1 rice cup of white rice
-   [ ] 8 cups water
-   [ ] 12 oz chicken (breast or thigh), thinly sliced
-   [ ] 1 tbsp oyster sauce
-   [ ] 2 tsp cornstarch
-   [ ] 2 tbsp water
-   [ ] 0.5 tsp chicken bouillon (for marinade)
-   [ ] 2 tbsp vegetable oil
-   [ ] 0.5 oz ginger, thinly sliced into matchsticks
-   [ ] 2 green onions, finely chopped
-   [ ] 1 bunch cilantro, roughly chopped
-   [ ] 1 tsp salt
-   [ ] 1 tsp chicken bouillon (for congee)

## Steps

1.  Before anything else, give your rice a good rinse in a bowl of water.

-   Fill the bowl with water
-   Massage and swirl the grains with your hand
-   Drain and repeat 2–3 times

::: {.callout-note title="Why wash?"}
Washing removes extra starch and dirt, preventing the congee from becoming too gummy.

2.  Boil 8 cups of water in a large pot while you prep your aromatics. Thinly slice ginger into matchsticks, and then chop green onions and cilantro

3.  Marinate the Chicken: Place the thinly sliced chicken in a bowl and marinate combining the oyster sauce, cornstarch, chicken boullion, and water for 30 seconds. Then add the vegetable oil and stir until glossy.

::: {.callout-tip title="Velveting Technique"}
The cornstarch + oil coating locks in moisture and keeps the chicken tender, just like at Cantonese restaurants.

4.  Once the pot is boiling, add the rinsed rice. Stir gently once.

::: {.callout-note title="Don't stir again!"}
Once it’s boiling again, stirring can cause the rice to stick to the bottom.

5.  Lower the heat to medium and partially cover. Let simmer for 25 minutes, or longer depending on your stove. This is the base of your congee — the silky rice-to-water blend known as jūk dái.

6.  After simmering, whisk vigorously for 2–3 minutes to break down the grains. If the rice is still solid, continue cooking for 10 more minutes.

::: {.callout-tip title="No whisk?"}
If you don’t have a whisk, use a wooden spoon and simmer for 10–20 minutes more.

7.  Raise the heat to high. Add the marinated chicken slowly while stirring, over 30–60 seconds. Stir for another 2 minutes until chicken is fully cooked.

8.  Add your sliced ginger, 1 tsp salt, and 1 tsp chicken bouillon. Stir and cook for 30 seconds.

9.  Turn off the heat and serve hot. Garnish each bowl with green onion and cilantro
