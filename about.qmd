I grew up in the PNW and moved to the Central Coast to attend UCSB, escape the rain, and bask my days in the sun.

I'm passionate about conservation science, marine biology, and climate outreach and education with experience working in research labs + non-profits.

Outside of academics, I'm interested in learning new recipes, traditional arts, and UI/UX design!
