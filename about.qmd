I grew up in the PNW and moved to the Central Coast to attend UCSB, escape the rain, and bask my days in the sun. ☀️

I'm passionate about conservation science, marine biology, and climate outreach and education with experience working in research labs + non-profits.

Outside of academics, I'm interested in learning new recipes, traditional arts, and UI/UX design!

I'm very to have grown up surrounded by my grandparents and cousins.

I was a big reader, especially when I was younger. I'd take my books everywhere I went: On the car, to the restaurants, ... and even when I took baths (sorry mom and dad!)
