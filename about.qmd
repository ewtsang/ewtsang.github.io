I grew up in Washington State and moved to the Central Coast in 2022 to attend UCSB, escape the rain, and bask my days in the sun ‚òÄÔ∏è

I'm passionate about conservation science, marine biology, and climate outreach and education with experience working in research labs + non-profits.

Outside of academics, I'm interested in learning new recipes, traditional arts, and UI/UX design!

### Our Immigration Story

<img src="images/grandparents.jpg" alt="My photo" style="width:150px; height:150px; border-radius:50%;"/>

My maternal grandparents (pictured above) immigrated to the United States in the 1980s, where my mom and her 5 siblings finished their schooling in Vancouver, WA.

My fraternal grandparents immigrated a decade before, but to the east coast, and my dad and his 2 siblings grew up in Baltimore, MA helping out at the family Chinese take-out restaurant.

My Popo loves telling her match-maker story of meeting my Mama and Yeye (fraternal grandparents) at the local Safeway and setting up their kids together over a game of mahjong.

I'm very lucky to have grown up surrounded by my grandparents and cousins.

### Bookworm
<img src="images/archive1.jpg" alt="My photo" style="width:150px; height:150px; border-radius:50%;"/>

I was a big reader, especially when I was younger. I'd take my books everywhere I went: On the car, to the restaurants ... and even when I took baths (sorry Mom and Dad!)

### A Letter to my 13 year old self
<img src="images/laufey.jpg" alt="My photo" style="width:150px; height:150px; border-radius:50%;"/>

I've played the violin ever since I was 10. Watching Laufey perform with the LA Philharmonic Orchestra was nothing but short of life-changing

### Live music

When I have the means and time (and money) -- I love going to live concerts. Whether it's solo or with friends. Here's a photo from one of my first concerts at a large venue, Joji at WAMU in Seattle.
