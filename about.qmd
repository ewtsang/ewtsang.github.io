title: "About"
---

-   I grew up in the PNW and moved to the Central Coast to attend UCSB, escape the rain, and bask my days in the sun.

-   I'm passionate about conservation science, marine biology, and climate outreach and education with experience working in research labs + non-profits.

-   Outside of academics, I'm interested in learning new recipes, traditional arts, and UI/UX design!
