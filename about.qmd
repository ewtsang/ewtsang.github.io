I grew up in Washington State and moved to the Central Coast in 2022 to attend UCSB, escape the rain, and bask my days in the sun ☀️

I'm passionate about conservation science, marine biology, and climate outreach and education with experience working in research labs + non-profits.

Outside of academics, I'm interested in learning new recipes, traditional arts, and UI/UX design!

## A childhood in the PNW...

I'm very lucky to have grown up surrounded by my grandparents and cousins.

Going on trips to the coast throughout my childhood reinforced my love for the beach!

I was a big reader, especially when I was younger. I'd take my books everywhere I went: On the car, to the restaurants, ... and even when I took baths (sorry mom and dad!)
