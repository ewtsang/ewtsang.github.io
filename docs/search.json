    "text": "I grew up in Washington State and moved to the Central Coast in 2022 to attend UCSB, escape the rain, and bask my days in the sun ☀️\nI’m passionate about conservation science, marine biology, and climate outreach and education with experience working in research labs + non-profits.\nOutside of academics, I’m interested in learning new recipes, traditional arts, and UI/UX design!\n⊹₊ ˚‧︵‿₊୨ ᰔ ୧₊‿︵‧ ˚ ₊⊹\n🎶Listen to my most recent playlist here:\n\n⊹₊ ˚‧︵‿₊୨ ᰔ ୧₊‿︵‧ ˚ ₊⊹\n\n\nOur Immigration Story\n\nMy maternal grandparents (pictured above) immigrated to the United States in the 1980s, where my mom and her 5 siblings finished their schooling in Vancouver, WA.\nMy fraternal grandparents immigrated a decade before, but to the east coast, and my dad and his 2 siblings grew up in Baltimore, MA helping out at the family Chinese take-out restaurant.\n\n\n\n\nMom and Dad\n\nMy Popo loves telling her match-maker story of meeting my Mama and Yeye (fraternal grandparents) at the local Safeway and setting up their kids together over a game of mahjong.\nMy dad had recently moved to Washington and was working designing computer chips. My mom was a recent graduate with an Accounting degree.\n\n\n\n\nA childhood in the PNW\n\nI’m very lucky to have grown up surrounded by my family, seeing my grandparents, aunts, uncles, and cousins on a weekly basis in my childhood.\nLooking back now, I am very grateful and privileged to have had family so close by, and to have had many role models.\n\n\n\n\nBeach bums\n\nGoing on trips to the coast throughout my childhood reinforced my love for the beach!\nThe family favorite was Canon Beach on the Oregon Coast.\n\n\n\n\nDidi\n\nMy little brother, my Didi has always been very artistic and has a lot of creative talent. He’s currently a junior in highschool.\nI’m very lucky to be an older sister! (I like forcing him to play Minecraft with me)\n\n\n\n\nBookworm\n\nI was a big reader, especially when I was younger. I’d take my books everywhere I went: On the car, to the restaurants … and even when I took baths (sorry Mom and Dad!)\n\n\n\n\nA Letter to my 13 year old self\n\nI’ve played the violin ever since I was 10. Watching Laufey perform with the LA Philharmonic Orchestra was nothing but short of life-changing\n\n\n\n\nHazel\n\nOn a random Tuesday, my parents texted me we had a surprise waiting at home after school. Turns out they decided to (uncharacteristically) adopt a cat from the Humane Society on whim.\nHazel’s favorite thing to eat are bannanas and bread.\n\n\n\n\nLive music\n\nWhen I have the means and time (and money) – I love going to live concerts. Whether it’s solo or with friends. Here’s a photo from one of my first concerts at a large venue, Joji at WAMU in Seattle."

Research Writing\n\n\n\n\nTransparent statistical methods\n\n\nIn part one, the coworker used a correlation test to assess that there is no relationship between distance from headwater (km) and annual total nitrogen load (kg year-1)\n\n\nIn part two, the coworker used a one-way ANOVA test to see whether average nitrogen load differs across multiple source types (urban land, atmospheric deposition, fertilizer, wastewater treatment, and grasslands)\n\n\n\n\n\nMore information needed\n\n\nWhat should also be included are (1) Effect size/dist for both analyses. For example, in part 1, was correlation positive? negative? how strong was it? A p-value by itself did not indicate the strength or nature of the relationship. (2) Post-hoc comparison for part 2 is needed. Since there are multiple nitrogen sources, a significant ANOVA should be followed by pairwise comparisons (Tukey’s HSD) to determine difference in sources. This would give better context for interpretation of which alnd uses are contributing the most to nitrogen.\n\n\n\n\nc. Suggestions for rewriting\n\n\nrevisit this problem——————————- Sites father from the river headwaters were associated with higher total annual nitrogen loads. We rejected the null hypotheses that there is no correlation between distance from headwater (km) and annual total nitrogen load (kg year-1). Using Pearson’s correlation, r = correlation coefficient, p = 0.03, a = 0.05\n\n\nNitrogen load varied significantly across different source types, indicating there is a key driver of elevated nitrogen levels to the system. We reject the null hypotheses that there is no difference in average nitrogen load between sources (urban land, atmospheric deposition, fertilizer, wastewater treatment, and grasslands) Using one way ANOVA, f=test statistic, df = degrees of freedom, p = 0.02, a = 0.05).A follow p post-hoc Tukey’s HSD test determined that ___ source (mean difference = average kg/year, p = p value) had significantly higher nitrogen loads than ___source (mean difference = average kg/year, p = p-value) no significant differences were found between other sources."

Data analysis\n\n\nWorking with the nest box occupancy dataset from Stojanovic, D., Owens, G., Young, C.M., Alves, F. and Heinsohn, R. 2021. “Do nest boxes breed the target species or its competitors? A case study of a critically endangered bird.” Restoration Ecology. DOI: 10.1111/rec.13319\n\n\nAnswering the following research questions: 1. How do year (2016 or 2019) and distance from forest edge predict Swift Parrot (Lathamus discolor) nest box occupancy? 2. Is there a simpler model that explains Swift Parrot nest box occupancy, and if so, what is it?\n\n\n\n\nResponse variable\n\n\nIn this dataset, a 1 or 0 marks nest box occupancy for the columns of either Swift Parrot, Common Starling, Tree Martins, or if the the nest box was empty. A 1 indicates occupancy and 0 indicates vacancy.\n\n\n\n\n\nPurpose of study\n\n\nThe study investigates how nest box occupancy by Swift Parrots and competing species (Tree Martins and Common Starlings) is influenced by distance from the forest edge and time since deployment. The researchers aim to evaluate whether permanent nest boxes benefit the endangered Swift Parrot or unintentionally support competitors.\n\n\n\n\nc. Difference in “seasons”\n\n\nIn 2016, the nest boxes were newly deployed, while in 2019 they were established and had been in place for 3 years.

Occupancy probability was higher in 2016 (new boxes) than 2019. This is likely because permanent boxes were learned and overtaken by competitors (esp. Common Starlings). Future management should prioritize temporary or seasonally-sealed boxes. ———To understand the biology behind the trends you found, you need to read the paper and look at the figures.
