    "text": "I grew up in the PNW and moved to the Central Coast to attend UCSB, escape the rain, and bask my days in the sun. ☀️\nI’m passionate about conservation science, marine biology, and climate outreach and education with experience working in research labs + non-profits.\nOutside of academics, I’m interested in learning new recipes, traditional arts, and UI/UX design!\nYou can also find my resume here\n\nCheck out what I’ve been up to recently:\n\n\n\nI’ve always loved exploring the coast. Pictured are my younger brother, Roland and I playing with sand at Canon Beach, OR – We often took short weekend vacations or day trips to the coast. The water was cold, so I spent most of my time building sandcastles or peering into tidepools.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen I find the time, I like to egg my friends to take nature walks with me. My favorite hike I have taken nearby was definitely the Gaviota Wind Caves. It involved a lot of scaling near the top, but the view was worth it!\n\n\n\nCheck out what else I’m up to:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFUERTE\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUVSA Tết Festival 2025\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNo matching items"
