Pictured are my younger brother, Roland and I playing with sand at Canon Beach, OR ‚Äì We often took short weekend vacations or day trips to the coast. The water was cold, so I spent most of my time building sandcastles or peering into tidepools.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen I find the time, I like to egg my friends to take nature walks with me. My favorite hike I have taken nearby was definitely the Gaviota Wind Caves. It involved a lot of scaling near the top, but the view was worth it!\n\n\n\nCheck out what else I‚Äôm up to:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFUERTE\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUVSA T·∫øt Festival 2025\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNo matching items"
