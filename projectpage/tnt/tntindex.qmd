*In collaboration with [Sanjana Sujeet](https://sanjanasujeet.github.io/)*. Tide and Terra is a passion project collaboration between me and my friend, Sanjana Sujeet, that combines both our interests of science communication and environmental issues with art and creative content.

This is a draft of our first issue that will be printed in June 2024!
