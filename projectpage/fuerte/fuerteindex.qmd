Funded by the U.S. National Science Foundation, FUERTE is is a three-year research program designed to build a foundation to succeed at the university and to develop the skills needed for a career in conservation and environmental sciences, areas that specifically involve fieldwork when doing research.

## Summer 1

My first summer began with a summer field trip to the Sierra Nevada Aquatic Research Laboratory ([SNARL](https://snarl.nrs.ucsb.edu/)). I learned about long-term place-based datasets, data collection and analysis. My personal project, working with Sanjana Sujeet and Andrea Estrada, examined plastic collected in the Eastern Sierras.

During my second summer, I participated in the DECOMP Lab. I worked with PhD Student, Germán Silva on *“Researching Wetland Plant Dynamics and Disturbance Response in a Changing Environment”*, examining how pickleweed plants can be used as environmental indicators.

I participated in on-site field research and sampling at UCSB’s North Campus Open Space and campus greenhouse.

Helped develop protocol and perform data collection for pickleweed sample prep, anthocyanin extraction, chlorophyll extraction, and soil EC measurements.

This summer, I will be working with [CFROG](https://cfrog.org/), a Ventura County-based advocacy organization leading a just transition away from fossil fuels to protect our health, economy, and climate.

🙌 Stay tuned for updates!
