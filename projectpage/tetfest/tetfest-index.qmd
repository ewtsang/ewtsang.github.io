# A Spring of Rememberance

## *“Xuân Hoài Niệm”*

This year, the [UVSA Tết Festival](https://tetfestival.org/) theme was “A Spring of Remembrance” or “Xuân Hoài Niệm”, to honor the efforts of the Vietnamese community in building a home abroad.

⊹₊ ˚‧︵‿₊୨ ᰔ ୧₊‿︵‧ ˚ ₊⊹

This year, I headed the 2025 Marketing Team for the nation's largest student-run Tết Festival (Vietnamese Lunar New Year celebration).

⊹₊ ˚‧︵‿₊୨ ᰔ ୧₊‿︵‧ ˚ ₊⊹

This was one of the scariest moments of my life. I had no idea what to expect going into this director position, but I was lucky to have a kind and forgiving team to support my learning curve.

⊹₊ ˚‧︵‿₊୨ ᰔ ୧₊‿︵‧ ˚ ₊⊹

This is what I accomplished:

➡️Developed and executed marketing campaigns overseeing a marketing budget of \$26,000 to target festival audiences, researching outlets, and collecting audience data to enhance sponsorship activations.

➡️Prepared press releases and managed all promotional information including in-person events, communication with media organizations, creation of promotional flyers, social media management, and through the www.tetfestival.org website.

➡️Managed and oversaw merchandise set-up, sales, communication, and inventory day-of the festival.
